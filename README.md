# Covid EDA Client

Simple covid 2019 data explanatory analysis and visualization.

## Server side

The API is built with FastAPI [Go to Repo](https://github.com/dgop92/covid-visual-eda)

## Project setup

Remember to create a .env file

### Download the dependencies with npm

```

### Run the app in localhost

```
npm start
```

## What I learned

- Working with a Dark theme palette
- Using a simplified version of the repository pattern in the client
- Creating data visualization on the frontend using apex-charts
- Lazy loading of data using intersection observer

This is what I learned in the frontend, for backend visit the backend repository

## Notes

The app is not optimized for small screens. Some chart types are difficult to display on smaller screens
